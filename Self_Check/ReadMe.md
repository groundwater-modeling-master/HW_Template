# Box Model- Self Check Exercise

Try to  build the following model on your own using FloPy and Groundwater Vistas. Solution files are provided so that you can check your work.

### Model Description
â€‹Build a steady state box model.  The model should have 25x25 cells, each 100 m in x and in y.  There is one layer, 10 m thick.  The medium is homogeneous with K = 1.0 m/day in x and y and 0.1 m/day in z.  The porosity is 0.35, specific yield is 0.3, and storage coefficient is 0.001.  The right boundary is constant flow with a total of 6.25 m3/day leaving the domain.  The left boundary is a constant head of 7 m relative to the datum, which is located at the bottom of the domain.

### Questions
What is the head gradient in the left half of the domain?  Visually, is the gradient constant across the domain?
