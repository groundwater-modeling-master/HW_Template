###  Instructions
I recommend you start by walking through the self check exercise contained in this repo. The exercise is described in the README of that directory and an IPython notebook and a solution key are also provided.

After you have done this, you should build and run the assignment below in the **Assignment** folder.

### Submission instructions
When you are ready to submit, you should copy the following items into the **Submission** folder for grading.

1. A pdf document titled **LastName_HWx_Summary.pdf** which has your written answers to the questions along with any graphs which support your case. This should be a complete document that summarizes your solution without referring to the IPython notebook.

2. IPython notebook(s) with your model(s) and analysis **LastName_HWx.ipynb**.

*Make sure you commit and push your changes so that your submission will be uploaded.*
